# Guess Which Flower?

### About the project:
- It is one of the classical Machine Learning Problem
- Using one of the most famous dataset: [Iris Dataset]() for classification
- The project tends to implement different machine learning classifiers to identify the plant species.
- The Models used are: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, SVC, Random Forest Classifier and LDA.
- The flowers are classified into one of the three species i.e. Iris-Versicolor(0), Iris-setosa(1), Iris-Virginica(2)

### How to use:
- Navigate to the jupyter notebook [guess_which_flower.ipynb]()
- Follow the steps and execute the cells as mentioned in the markdown cells given in the notebook

### Results and Further Work / Improvements
- Due to the low bias, the Gaussian Naive Bayes Model was able to perfectly predict all the test samples giving the highest cross validation score.
- The project can be further worked on by using different means of accuracy calculation like the GridSearch, ConfusionMatrix, etc
- Also, more versatile feature selector methods can help get dominant output
- Anyone willing to colaborate on improvements can reach out through [LinkedIn]() or from an issue on [GitHub]()
- The following graph shows the cross validation score of each model under same training conditions
