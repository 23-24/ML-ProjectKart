Used machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck
The model I used to predict was initially Naive Bayes but since the accuracy score was less, other models used are:

1.Decision Tree Classifier
2.KNeighborsClassifier
3.Random Forest Classifier
4.Support Vector Machine
