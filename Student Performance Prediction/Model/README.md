**Student Preformance Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict final grade of the student from features  etc.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here]().

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data visualization
- Step 3: Data training
- Step 4: Model Creation
- Step 5: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Multi Linear Regression
-  Lasso Regression
-  Ridge Regression
-  Decision Tree Regressor



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  78.81
 ``` 
 - By using Lasso Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  78.81
 ``` 
 - By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  78.81
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.91
 ``` 
* Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, lasso regression and rigde regression is almost same. 

* Whereas accuracy of decision tree regressor is higher and root mean sqaure error is least.

* Decision tree regressor is more efficient model.
