**GOAL**

The goal is to predict Advertisement Success.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fayomi/advertising)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which Advertisement Success depends.
- Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting success rate of Advertisement.
- Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  Decission Tree
-  K Nearest Neighbour
-  Random Forest Classifier

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**
By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 89.33333333333333
    Accuracy of testing data: 90.8
 ``` 
 
 By using Support Vector Machine (SVM) I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 71.73333333333333
    Accuracy of testing data: 70.0
 ``` 
 
 By using Decission Tree I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 100.0
    Accuracy of testing data: 58.13253012048193
 ``` 
 
 By using K Nearest Neighbour I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 100.0
    Accuracy of testing data: 93.60000000000001
 ``` 
 
 
 By using Random Forest Classifier I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 100.0
    Accuracy of testing data: 94.8
 ```
