**Heart Disease Prediction**

**GOAL** <br>
The goal of this project is to predict heart disease form features like age, cholesterol level, blood sugar level etc.

**DATASET**<br>
Dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**<br>
- I used seaborn to visualize the correlation between the features.
- Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.

**MODELS USED**
-  Support Vector Machine(SVM)
-  K-Nearest Neighbors

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**<br>
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**<br>
By using SVM I got 
 ```python
    Train set Accuracy:  90.90
    Test set Accuracy:   85.24
 ``` 

 By using K-nearest neighbors I got 
 ```python
    Train set Accuracy:  83.88
    Test set Accuracy:   83.60
 ```
