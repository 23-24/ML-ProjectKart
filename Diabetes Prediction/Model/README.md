**GOAL**

The goal is to predict if a person is having Diabetes or not.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which cancer depends.
- Handling outliers of outcome column. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting diabetes.
- Then I used Classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Also I have used SVM models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**
By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 0.7719869706840391
    Accuracy of testing data: 0.8246753246753247
 ``` 

By using SVM I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 0.7736156351791531
    Accuracy of testing data: 0.8116883116883117
 ```
